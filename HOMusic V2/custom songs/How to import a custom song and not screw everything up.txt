Alright so first thing you're gonna wanna do is install Audacity which can be found here:
https://www.audacityteam.org/download/

You're also going to want the LAME encoder in the aptly named LAME folder for re-exporting your file as an mp3.
Audacity should ask you to locate it when you try and export as MP3 for the first time.

Now get your juicy mp3, plug it into Audacity and click File > Export As > MP3, name it custom.mp3 and save it in the custom songs foler.
Make sure you change the "Quality" of the song to 160kbps (as shown in picture HelpMe1.)

Once you've done that, close the old file, open up your shiny new 160kbps mp3 in audacity, and take a loot at the bottom bar.
Click the little arrow (either of them) next to the timing info and change the selection to "Samples."
Press Ctrl-A to select the whole song and take note of the number on the right, that's your sample count (As shown in HelpMe2.)

Not all that you need to do is enter the sample count into the mod. Make sure it's formatted as a plain number (eg 16578432.)
Congratulations! You've just added your own song to Halo Online.

Please note that REALLY long songs (the limit was just over six minutes but I've increased it a bit) the looping can sometimes not trigger right.
I'd reccomend you just use a shorter song but if you really HAVE to have your insane megamix as your menu theme, try increasing the Encoded Size.
PitchRanges[0].Permutations[0].PermutationChunks[0].EncodedSize 78734464 <- this number here.
It's in the batch file, or you could edit it yourself with assembly/tagtool.
