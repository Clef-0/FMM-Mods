Name=FMM update needed
Author=Clef
Version=N/A
Desc=GitHub no longer supports Subversion, which how FMM downloads mods from its repository. As a result, you will need to download an update from https://fmm.mx.mt/ (this is a short link to the usual page on the r/HaloOnline subreddit wiki). FMM2.02 (the update needed) is also included in the ElDewrito community patch (QOL7), pinned on the subreddit.
