Halo Online Music Replacer V2 by Jalex

Welcome to the Halo Online Main Menu Music Mod (HOMMMM if you want but I jsut call it HOMusic) 
Includes a bunch of the halo games main menu themes, and a couple of extras to spice things up a bit.
If you're a real smart cookie you can even use WHATEVER SONG YOU WANT. Isn't that neat!

If you're reading this, it means you've installed through fmm and didn't instantly try to install it through the launcher, which is great cause I have NO idea how well this mod will work thought the launcher given it has an actual menu.
To run the mod just run the batch file, everything else is explained within here, or the custom song readme.

KNOWN BUGS:
When importing really long custom sounds(limit used to be just over six minutes but I've upped that so you shouldn't run into any issues) may cause the song to stop early with a pause before restarting.
Grav lift sound plays at the end of one of the songs.

Enjoy, Spartan o7
