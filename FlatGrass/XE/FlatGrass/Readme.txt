Known Bugs:

When in forge mode on any FlatGrass variant if you round restart the map goes dark.
This is caused by the default spawn point causing a shadow glitch over the BSP.

To fix this delete the Default Spawn Point and replace it with another in forge.
Make sure you replace it or you will not be able to spawn back into your map.
