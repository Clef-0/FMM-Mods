1.2 :
Now that I have a new hardware I can play mcc and extract its texture
now the MCC Crosshair is almost completed

MCC crosshair changed:
Carbine, Spartan Laser, Shotgun, Beam Rifle, Sentinel beam, and Mauler.

Added custom Crosshair.

Reduced the File size to the image by using the BC2 Compression

Removed Jalex Advanced install because I see no purpose on it tbh
